This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) full-stack application designed for online Finnish language courses. It incorporates essential features such as authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access. User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt for data protection.

The application is hosted on Render for reliable deployment, and testing is implemented using Supertest and Jest to ensure its functionality and reliability.
